### Explanations of technologies used
MERN stack: Node.js, Mongoose, Express, React, React Bootstrap and SASS.
### Approach
We started out using by creating the bare bones of the front end and back. We then worked on the the authentication and getting all our routes working.
### Unsolved Problems / Things for the future
-   Adding the ability for users to add comments to the restaurants
-   When users comments, add their picture
-   In user profile, add link to restaurants in favorites OR add a way to preview them (cards, for example)
-   Add carousel of users to the homepage, make it feel like a community
-   Be able to filter by city, restaurant type, etc
### User Stories
Users can create an account and log into and out of their accounts. They have the ability to view all restauarants and all users, add their favorite restaurants to their profiles page, edit and delete.
### Notes - Other additions for down the road
-   Create more robust user and restaurant pages (ability to like, comment, more information, etc.)
-   Add a search bar
-   Be able to communicate/interact with other users
### Link to live app
